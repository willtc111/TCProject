This is a test message.
Dictating my sister's response to "Say something that will be a test message for my program".

Ah.  What.  That's a lot of pressure.  Are you writing everything I'm saying?
STAHP!
Uh.  Say something about baked macaroni on thanksgiving.
Is your professor going to see this?  Is he going to see that I just asked that?
Oops.  haha.  Did you write that?  Haha.  Well, now I feel bad.
When you say professor you never know if it's a man or a woman.
She's going to think I'm five.  hahaha.
Lucy stop licking the wall!  hahahahaha.
